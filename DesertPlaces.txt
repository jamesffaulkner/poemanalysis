<poem>
1 Snow falling and night falling fast, oh, fast
2 In a field I looked into going past,
3 And the ground almost covered smooth in snow,
4 But a few weeds and stubble showing last.
5 The woods around it have it - it is theirs.
6 All animals are smothered in their lairs.
7 I am too absent-spirited to count;
8 The loneliness includes me unawares.
9 And lonely as it is, that loneliness
10 Will be more lonely ere it will be less -
11 A blanker whiteness of benighted snow
12 With no expression, nothing to express.
13 They cannot scare me with their empty spaces
14 Between stars - on stars where no human race is.
15 I have it in me so much nearer home
16 To scare myself with my own desert places.
