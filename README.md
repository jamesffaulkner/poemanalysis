# poemanalysis
Project to create a tool to help students learn to analyze poetry using OpenAI API


## Basics
This tool is inspired by language learning primers like [this Latin student aid](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101015068578&seq=15) for Vergil's *Aeneid*.


## Sample Output on "Desert Places"

Analysis:

1 'Snow falling and night falling fast, oh, fast' : Repetition of 'falling' emphasizes the rapid pace of the snow and night.  
2 'In a field I looked into going past' : Enjambment connects the speaker's action of looking into the field with the movement of going past it.  
3 'But a few weeds and stubble showing last' : Imagery of the remaining weeds and stubble in the snow-covered field.  
5 'The woods around it have it - it is theirs' : Personification of the woods claiming ownership of the field.  
6 'All animals are smothered in their lairs' : Hyperbole to emphasize the depth of the snow and the animals' seclusion.  
7 'I am too absent-spirited to count' : Metaphor comparing the speaker's lack of attention to being absent-spirited.  
9 'And lonely as it is, that loneliness' : Repetition of 'loneliness' emphasizes the speaker's isolation.  
11 'A blanker whiteness of benighted snow' : Metaphor comparing the snow to a blank, expressionless whiteness.  
13 'They cannot scare me with their empty spaces' : Metonymy, using 'empty spaces' to represent the vastness of the universe.  
14 'Between stars - on stars where no human race is' : Imagery of the vastness of space and the absence of human presence.  
16 'To scare myself with my own desert places' : Metaphor comparing the speaker's inner loneliness to a desert.
